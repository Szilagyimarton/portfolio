     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>In the past few years, I worked as a musician and a music teacher. I graduated as a jazz-drummer at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music. I've always been interested in programming, so recently I decided to change my career path.  In early 2023, I began learning front-end development on my own, and after a while, I decided to take a course at CodeCool. I signed up for their Front-end Developer Course and I succesfully completed it and now I'm eagerly looking forward to securing first job as a developer!  I'm  open to learning new technologies and I'm always seeking opportunities to learn new skills. I consider myself  hardworking, persistent, creative and open-minded.  </p>
