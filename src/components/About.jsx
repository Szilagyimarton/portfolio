     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>In the past few years I worked as a musician and a music teacher. I graduated as a jazz-drummer at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music. I've always been interested in programming so recently I decided to change my career path to an other direction.  In 2023 I started to learn front-end development on my own and after while I decided to take a course at CodeCool. I signed up for their Front-end Developer Course and I succesfully accomplished it. I'm eagerly looking forward to get my first job as a developer!   </p>
