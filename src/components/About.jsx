     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>In the past few years I worked as a musician and a music teacher. I graduated as a jazz-drummer at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music. I've always been interested in programming, so recently I decided to change my career path to a different  direction.  In early 2023 I began learning front-end development on my own and after a while I decided to take a course at CodeCool. I signed up for their Front-end Developer Course and I succesfully accomplished it and now I'm eagerly looking forward to get my first job as a developer!  I'm  open to learning new technologies and I'm always seeking opportunities to learn technologies which I'm unfamiliar with. I consider myself  hardworking, persistent, creative and open-minded.  </p>
